I have seen so many people having issues with installing the linux version, so i decided to list a setup a guide.
This is also due to some errors I found while installing mine, so this should make it easier for everyone!

These are the dependencies listed on most coin repository

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev -y

I have included some extras that help bypass some of the issues and are not mentioned as dependencies on the documentation of most coins.

sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libevent-dev bsdmainutils libgmp3-dev -y

On at least Ubuntu 14.04+ and Debian 7+ there are generic names for the individual boost development packages, so the following can be used to only install necessary parts of boost:

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y


This is a must to avoid errors

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev -y

sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev -y

cd /home

git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git

cd secp256k1/
./autogen.sh
./configure
  make
./tests
sudo make install  # optional

cd ..

git clone <your coin wallet repository>
cd /<your coin name>/src
make -f makefile.unix

Some coin will have different method of installing.

cd <your coin name>/
./autogen.sh
./configure
  make
sudo make install  # optional

 
 all should be installed and you can start your daemon
 
 ./<your coind> -daemon
