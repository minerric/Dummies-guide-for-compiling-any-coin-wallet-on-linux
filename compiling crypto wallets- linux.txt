I have seen so many people having issues with installing the linux version, so i decided to list a setup a guide.
This is also due to some errors I found while installing mine, so this should make it easier for everyone!

This guide assumes you already have a vps ordered and putty connected to it as root

Note: any info inside and including <> is meant to be replaced to your coin specific name or repo! DO NOT JUST COPY AND PASTE FROM THIS GUIDE
 ./<your coind> -daemon will need to be changed to something like ./dashd -daemon for example.
<your coin wallet repository> will need to be replaced by the link to the repository of the coin you are trying to setup.


First some basics.

Create a Swap File - Low Ram Servers
 sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
 sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
 sudo mkswap /swapfile
 sudo swapon /swapfile
 sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add to fstab file by using arrow down and pasting the following on the file after all that already is there
/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0

once done press CTRL x
press y
press enter  # done

These are the dependencies listed on most coin repository

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev -y

I have included some extras that help bypass some of the issues and are not mentioned as dependencies on the documentation of most coins.

sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libevent-dev bsdmainutils libgmp3-dev -y

On at least Ubuntu 14.04+ and Debian 7+ there are generic names for the individual boost development packages, so the following can be used to only install necessary parts of boost:

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y


This is a must to avoid errors

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev -y

sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev -y

cd /home

git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git

cd secp256k1/
./autogen.sh
./configure
  make
./tests
sudo make install  # optional

cd ..

git clone <your coin wallet repository>
cd <your coin name>/src
make -f makefile.unix

Some coin will have different method of installing.

cd <your coin name>/
./autogen.sh
./configure
  make
sudo make install  # optional

 
 all should be installed and you can start your daemon
 
 ./<your coind> -daemon
 
 ####################################################################
 If your intention is to setup a masternode then please make sure you do not hold coins on VPS
 
 On Windows or Mac wallet or even Linux if you use desktop edition.
 
 Send the required amount of coins for the masternode
 Generate a private key on your local wallet get the masternode outputs and create the configuration file accordingly
 
 on the vps side once you synced your wallet go to:
 
 cd /root/.<coin_name>
 nano <coin_name>

this will open config file all you need to do is paste the following and amend accordingly

rpcuser=yourusername
rpcpassword=yourpassword
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
daemon=1
server=1
listen=1
masternodeaddr=x.x.x.x:PORT
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey=privatekey

please make sure that the info for the masternode section matches your local wallet on your computer.

once this is done press 
CTRL x

then press y and press ENTER

Go back to your wallet/src directory stop the daemon and restart it again.

now vps side is done we need to go to the local wallet to start the masternode.

if you only have 1 masternode in your wallet go to console and type

masternode start

if you have more than one you can run a simlar command

masternode start-alias <name_of_alias>

happy masternoding


Note: any info inside <> is meant to be replaced to your coin specific name or repo!
